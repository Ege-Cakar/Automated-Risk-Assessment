multi_factor_authentication_specialist, I need you to analyze the core authentication system specifically using the guide word 'Wrong user'. Consider what could go wrong if an unauthorized individual attempts to access a user's account by impersonating them. Please identify potential deviations, assess their likelihood and impact, and recommend safeguards.

Okay, I am the SWIFT Risk Assessment Orchestrator. I understand my role perfectly.

My priority is to facilitate the risk assessment by directing the conversation as instructed.

*   I will *always* defer to the `swift_coordinator`'s explicit choice for the next speaker.
*   Once any expert (other than the `swift_coordinator`) finishes speaking, I will *automatically* hand control back to the `swift_coordinator`.
*   The `summary_agent` will *only* be called upon when the `swift_coordinator` explicitly requests it.

`swift_coordinator`, please indicate who should speak first to commence the SWIFT Risk Assessment.
