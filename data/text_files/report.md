# SWIFT Risk Assessment Report

## Introduction
This report documents the application of the Structured What-If Technique (SWIFT) for risk assessment within our target system. The SWIFT methodology enables systematic identification, analysis, and mitigation of potential risks through collaborative brainstorming, scenario analysis, and structured prioritization. The primary objective of this assessment is to proactively uncover vulnerabilities, evaluate potential consequences, and recommend actionable safeguards to strengthen system resilience.

## Section 1: Preparation and Scoping
In this section, we define the scope and objectives of the SWIFT analysis, assemble the multi-disciplinary team, and highlight relevant documentation to guide the assessment process.# SWIFT Risk Assessment for User Onboarding and Identity Verification

## Section 1: Preparation and Scoping

**Description:**
This SWIFT (Structured What-If Technique) risk assessment focuses on the user onboarding and identity verification process within our system. The objective is to proactively identify and manage potential risks related to authentication, access control, and data security during the onboarding phase. The scope includes all technical and procedural components that contribute to the registration and initial validation of new users. Out of scope are post-registration user activities and unrelated infrastructure components.

**Scope:**
- In Scope: User identity proofing, verification mechanisms, onboarding workflows, access control setup, initial data capture, and integration points with identity providers.
- Out of Scope: Ongoing user activities post-onboarding, unrelated network infrastructure, and legacy authentication systems not in use for onboarding.

**Objectives:**
- Ensure the robustness and security of user onboarding and identity verification.
- Identify vulnerabilities that could allow unauthorized access or fraudulent registration.
- Recommend safeguards to enhance trust, compliance, and operational resilience.

### Section 2: What-If Brainstorming Session

**Scope Focus:** User onboarding, identity verification, and access control setup.

The next step is to systematically brainstorm potential deviations using "what-if" scenarios related to identity proofing, onboarding flows, and initial authentication mechanisms.
