To: University Safety Office
From: Per Ola Kristensson, Estates & Facilities Division
Date: July 16, 2025
Subject: Risk Assessment Request for New Fire Alarm System Deployment â€“ Department of Engineering Buildings

This document is a formal request for a comprehensive risk assessment to be conducted for the planned deployment of a new, addressable fire alarm system across all buildings of the Department of Engineering, located on the Trumpington Street site.

1.0 Project Description
The project involves the decommissioning of the existing fire alarm system and the full installation, testing, and commissioning of a modern, site-wide addressable fire alarm system. This upgrade is essential to enhance the life safety provisions within the department and ensure compliance with current fire safety standards.

The work will be undertaken by an approved external contractor and will encompass all areas, including laboratories, workshops, lecture theatres, offices, and common spaces.

Proposed Start Date: October 1, 2025

Estimated Completion Date: March 31, 2026

2.0 Scope of Assessment
A thorough risk assessment is required before any work commences to identify potential hazards and establish robust control measures. The assessment should be conducted in accordance with the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 and the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005.

Key areas to be considered should include, but are not limited to:

Hot Work: Potential for soldering, brazing, or cutting during installation.

Electrical Hazards: Isolation of circuits, connection of new system components, and management of temporary wiring.

Working at Height: Use of ladders, scaffolding, or mobile elevating work platforms (MEWPs) for cabling and device installation.

Asbestos: Management of potential disturbance to asbestos-containing materials (ACMs) in older sections of the buildings.

System Crossover: Risks associated with the period when the old system is being decommissioned and the new system is not yet fully operational.

Disruption: Noise, dust, and obstruction of access/egress routes.

Contractor Management: Ensuring contractor competency, safe systems of work, and coordination with departmental activities.

False Alarms: Procedures for managing and communicating potential false alarms during the testing and commissioning phase.

3. Action required

Work on-site cannot be authorized until the risk assessment is formally completed and approved. Please generate a thorough risk assessment that leaves no stone unturned and submit it to the University for approval.
