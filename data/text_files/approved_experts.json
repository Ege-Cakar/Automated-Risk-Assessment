Consequence and Cause Analysis:\n   - Determine potential consequences: data exfiltration, system tampering, compliance violations.\n   - Identify root causes: inadequate controls, orphaned accounts, shared credentials, weak review processes.\n\n4. Identification of Existing Safeguards:\n   - Assess current controls: PAM solutions, session recording, just-in-time access, recurring access reviews.\n\n5. Risk Assessment and Prioritization:\n   - Likelihood (1=Very Unlikely to 5=Very Likely)\n   - Impact (1=Negligible to 5=Catastrophic)\n   - Use semi-quantitative risk matrix to prioritize high-risk scenarios.\n\n6. Recommendations and Action Plans:\n   - Propose actions: enforce separation of duties, implement time-bound just-in-time privileges, enhance monitoring, automate deprovisioning.\n   - Assign responsibilities and deadlines.\n\n7. Documentation and Follow-up:\n   - Record all scenarios, assessments, and recommendations in a SWIFT report.\n   - Schedule periodic reviews of privileged access controls.\n\nExample What-If Scenarios:\n\u2022 What if an administrator\u2019s account is compromised and used to disable logging? \n\u2022 What if a privileged session is hijacked via shared credentials? \n\u2022 What if a terminated employee\u2019s privileges remain active? \n\u2022 What if break-glass emergency accounts are misused without audit logs? \n\nRisk Matrix Criteria:\nLikelihood: 1=Very Unlikely, 2=Unlikely, 3=Possible, 4=Likely, 5=Very Likely\nImpact: 1=Negligible, 2=Minor, 3=Moderate, 4=Major, 5=Catastrophic",
