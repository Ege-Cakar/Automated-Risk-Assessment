---------- TextMessage (swift_coordinator) ----------
We have finalized an exhaustive set of deep-dive questions covering security, infrastructure, compliance, privacy, operational assurance, and user-facing considerations for the GHIP Secure Login System. Key points:  

1. Eight principal domains—from account recovery and admin controls through consent management and DPIAs—each with targeted asks for our four experts.  
2. Added operational dimensions: continuous testing cadence, user training, supply-chain integrity, cryptographic key lifecycle, cross-border data flows, accessibility alternatives, and non-repudiation logging.  
3. Agreed deliverable timeline: expert analyses due EOD in three business days.  
4. Post-input phases: consolidate into a risk matrix (likelihood × impact), draft mitigation controls, then hold a one-hour review session to finalize the assessment.

No further clarifications are outstanding. We now await the experts’ detailed responses per the agreed schedule.
---------- TextMessage (encryption_and_cryptography_expert) ----------
The proposed cryptographic engagement plan covers the major domains—transit/rest protections, key lifecycle, PKI management, non-repudiation and quantum-ready considerations. To reach full readiness, we need explicit specifications around password KDFs/MFA, TLS forward-secrecy policies, FIPS-level/HSM details, certificate revocation/disaster-recovery procedures, cross-border key handling, quantum-hybrid designs, entropy monitoring, and SBOM-driven supply chain controls. Once those details are woven into the Day 1 outline, the expert track is set to deliver on schedule.
---------- TextMessage (identity_verification_and_onboarding_expert) ----------
The proposed “fills” comprehensively address each of the earlier question-marks and, taken together, form a cohesive Day-1 crypto plan ready for the expert track. Key strengths and final observations:

1. Password KDFs & MFA  
   • Argon2id tuned for ~500 ms runtime, with fallback PBKDF2 for legacy clients.  
   • System-wide pepper in FIPS 140-2 L3 HSM, rotated quarterly.  
   • Multi-tiered MFA recovery (emergency codes, AI-driven ID+selfie, trusted-referee vouching) with real-time risk scoring.  
   • Clear rate-limit and credential-stuffing thresholds with automated soft locks and SecOps alerts.

2. TLS Forward-Secrecy & Policy  
   • TLS 1.3 only (90-day sunset for 1.2), 0-RTT disabled initially.  
   • Dynamic service-pinning via Vault, HSTS, OCSP stapling, CT logs for eIDAS.  
   • Envoy/Istio telemetry into SIEM to detect downgrade attempts.

3. FIPS Level / HSM Details  
   • Dual-control key ceremonies, separate HSM clusters for code-signing vs user certificates.  
   • Escrow shares in offline vaults under distinct quorums, emergency unseal via IR playbook + Exec.  
   • Transition plan to FIPS 140-3 by Q2 ’25 with interim dual-validation.

4. Certificate Revocation & Disaster Recovery  
   • CRLs every 6 h, OCSP must-staple, CT SCT verification.  
   • Automated Lambda-driven intermediate re-issues on health or expiration alerts.  
   • Quarterly DR drills for both online and offline CAs with post-mortems.

5. Cross-Border Key Handling  
   • Geo-fenced KMS/HSM usage with Splunk auditing and quarterly GRC review.  
   • High-impact shares in restricted regions, requiring dual custodian + Legal sign-off.  
   • Mapped to ITAR/EAR in a “Crypto Compliance Matrix.”

6. Quantum-Hybrid Designs  
   • Pluggable TLS provider for Kyber + ECDH and Dilithium + ECDSA.  
   • Hybrid code-signing for containers/firmware, with a 6-month ECDSA-only compatibility fallback.  
   • CI/CD “kill switch” feature flag for rapid rollback.

7. Entropy Monitoring  
   • Per-cluster DRBG health tests every 30 s, min-entropy 0.99.  
   • Automatic reseed/failover to Linux HWRNG on TPM/RDRAND failure within 1 min.  
   • Boot self-test logs with high-priority tickets on failure.

8. SBOM-Driven Supply-Chain Controls  
   • Ingest SLSA v3 attestation from SigStore into a central trust store.  
   • Enforce vendor-signed Tier 1 libs; quarterly risk scans for others (CVSS ≥7).  
   • Quarterly audits of core crypto stacks and any newly onboarded modules.

Cross-Cutting Governance  
– Crypto Agility Policy v1.0 with PR/workflow in GitLab  
– Compliance matrix mapping to NIST SP 800-57, eIDAS Annex II, HIPAA §164.312, GDPR Art. 32  
– User cert TTL aligned to IAL2 proofing; 7-year write-once audit logging  

Next Steps  
1. Final review and sign-off of these fills.  
2. Merge into the Day-1 Playbook and publish Crypto Policy v1.0.  
3. Kick off HSM integration sprints, SBOM pipeline integration, and schedule the first DR drill.

With these details confirmed, the expert track has a fully specified Day-1 blueprint and can proceed immediately with design, policy authoring, and implementation.
---------- TextMessage (swift_coordinator) ----------
The Day-1 crypto blueprint is exceptionally thorough, demonstrating strong alignment with industry best practices, regulatory mandates, and future-proofing requirements. Key strengths include robust KDF/MFA design, strict TLS policies, well-governed HSM operations, comprehensive DR/CRL processes, geo-fencing and compliance mapping for cross-border keys, quantum-hybrid support, proactive entropy health checks, and SBOM-driven supply-chain controls—underpinned by a formal Crypto Agility Policy and compliance matrix.

Minor gaps and clarifications before full sign-off:  
1. Argon2id Performance at Scale  
   • Verify Argon2id’s ~500 ms latency under concurrent peak loads across device classes. Define fallback thresholds and adaptive throttling to avoid service degradation.  
2. Emergency-Code Risk Scoring  
   • Confirm trigger thresholds for soft-locks and SecOps alerts to balance usability versus brute-force prevention.  
3. Telemetry Ingestion Resilience  
   • Ensure Envoy/Istio telemetry volume won’t flood SIEM during high-traffic spikes; define back-pressure or sampling strategies and false-positive tuning.  
4. HSM Emergency Unseal Path  
   • Validate that dual-custodian quorum and Exec approval steps integrate seamlessly with the incident response system and aren’t impeded by off-hour constraints.  
5. Regulatory Frequency Alignment  
   • Although a 6-hour CRL cycle exceeds eIDAS and most SLAs, confirm no downstream reliance on longer refresh intervals (e.g. older clients, offline caches).  
6. Cross-Border Matrix Coverage  
   • Ensure the Crypto Compliance Matrix explicitly addresses data-export restrictions post-Schrems II, including adequacy decisions and standard contractual clauses.  
7. Post-Quantum Rollback Triggers  
   • Clarify precise conditions under which the CI/CD “kill switch” reverts to ECDSA-only mode, and validate interoperability testing plans for all supported TLS stacks.  
8. SBOM Remediation Workflows  
   • Define SLAs for vulnerability triage based on CVSS/Risk ratings, and enforcement mechanisms (e.g. automated patch-and-block pipelines) for outdated or high-risk libraries.

Once these points are validated by the assigned experts, the plan can be merged into the Day-1 Playbook, Crypto Policy v1.0, and the implementation sprints can commence immediately.
